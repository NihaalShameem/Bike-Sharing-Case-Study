# Bike-Sharing-Case-Study
 Cyclistic is a bike sharing company in Chicago. I am acting as a junior data analyst on their marketing team answering to Lily Moreno, the director of marketing and my manager. They feature over 5800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. It offers many bike types and we focus on classic bikes and electric bike types in this case study. Below are some of the questions from the data given:
#### How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
#### Why would casual members buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
#### How can Cyclystic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
